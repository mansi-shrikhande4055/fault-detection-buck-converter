# Fault Detection in Buck Converter using Machine Learning ⚡

This is a simple project where I used Python and machine learning to detect faults in a Buck Converter using voltage and current waveforms.

---

## 🔍 What this project does

- Simulates 3 cases:
  - Normal condition
  - Short circuit fault
  - Open load fault
- Plots voltage and current signals
- Trains a Random Forest model to identify which condition it is
- Shows how machine learning can be used in power electronics

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for ML)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Files in this project

- `Fault-Detection-Buck-Converter-ML.ipynb` → My main code notebook
- `README.md` → This file
